## Description

Foodar is a food delivery service application. Foodies will order take-out from
a local restaurant, then use Foodar to find a Driver to pick up and deliver it
to them. Delivery fees will be calculated based on distance driven, plus a
base fee. Users must register a card to autopay drivers the approved amount.

 

### User Roles:

**Foodie**: will create a delivery mission to pick up their food from a restaurant.

**Driver**: can accept delivery missions, and manage income.
 

Primary stakeholders have decided that Foodar users should have the ability to
register for a Foodar account and view a simple website that advertises its
services. Now that you know a little about the system, we'll get you setup with
some coding. We'll add more information to the SRS in a later activity.

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for developers and testers who are responsible for the development of the platform. It provides the information necessary to design, develop, and test the software.


### Scope

This document serves as a description of the required improvements to the project. It contains a workflow description, functional and nonfunctional requirements, and appropriate diagrams to fully describe the system.


### System Overview

This enterprise project consists of one layer; the front-end. This layer is the primary portal through which users will interact with the application. JavaScript is used to enhance a user's experience and provide additional functionality.

The above graphic describes the different components that you'll use to implement using the technologies that we'll introduce to you. It follows a design pattern called MVC or Model, View, Controller. For now you just need to know that it consists of three parts"

- one that is the visual part that users interact with: the view,
- one that represents the object being modeled: the model,
- and something that manages data between the different parts: the controller.
